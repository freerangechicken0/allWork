				<h2>PlayStation 5 Confirmed</h2>
				<img class="img-70" src="ps5.jpg" alt="PS5 News Thumbnail">
				<h3>PlayStation 5 set to release in 2020</h3>
				<p>Sony representatives have revealed substantial new details about the company's upcoming 
				PlayStation 5 console in an interview with Wired. New features and improvements will include
				 sophisticated haptics in the controller, hardware ray tracing, and a UI that lets users see 
				 in-game information before launching a game. Additionally, Sony confirmed that the console 
				 will be called the PlayStation 5 and that it will launch before the holidays in 2020.</p>
				<p>Mark Cerny, the architect of the PlayStation 4, has returned as chief architect for the 
				PlayStation 5. Earlier this year, he sat down with Wired to demonstrate Sony's work to eliminate
				 load times with extremely fast solid-state drives and improved software stacks and I/O to 
				 accompany them. In that demonstration, a fast-travel load in Spider-Man went from 19 seconds
				  on current PS4 hardware to less than one second on new hardware.</p>

				<h2>Google Stadia</h2>

				<h3>Stadia to be "faster" than local gaming hardware</h3>
				<p>Google Stadia will be faster and more responsive than local gaming systems in 
				“a year or two,” according to VP of engineering Madj Bakar. Thanks to some precog 
				trickery, Google believes its streaming system will be faster than the gaming systems
				 of the near-future, no matter how powerful they may become. But if the system is 
				 playing itself, does that really count?</p>
				<p>Speaking with Alex Wiltshire in Edge magazine #338, Google’s top streaming engineer 
				claims the company is verging on gaming superiority with its cloud streaming service, 
				Stadia, thanks to the advancements it’s making in modelling and machine learning. It’s 
				even eyeing up the gaming performance crown in just a couple of years.</p>
				<p>“Ultimately, we think in a year or two we’ll have games that are running faster 
				and feel more responsive in the cloud than they do locally,” Bakar says to Edge, 
				“regardless of how powerful the local machine is.”</p>
