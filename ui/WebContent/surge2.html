				<h2>The Surge 2</h2>
				<p>Sequels are a tricky business. The best of them not only manage to recapture 
				what people enjoyed about the original, but also find ways to enhance them while 
				effectively introducing new ideas. On the flip-side, there are plenty of instances 
				where, despite a few new good ideas and generally high quality, the sequel doesn’t 
				create quite as much of an impression. The Surge 2 fits snugly into the latter 
				category: this return to the sci-fi Souls-like action game realm hacks and slashes 
				just as hard – harder, in some cases – but falls just short of recapturing the same 
				dismembering joy.</p>
				<p>On paper, The Surge 2 does exactly what it should in order to achieve the goals 
				of a sequel: it’s retained a lot of what worked in the first game, and throws in a 
				few solid system updates and quality-of-life improvements aimed at making a better 
				version of the original. However, there are some environmental design and 
				storytelling decisions that eliminate some of the original’s charm and cause the 
				story to trip over its own feet.</p>
				<img class="gif" src="surge2.gif" alt="The Surge 2 Gif">
				<p>The Surge 2 takes place in the ruins of Jericho City (complete with its own big 
				wall, definitely no biblical allegories here), the closest metropolis to the 
				ill-fated CREO facility, after a mysterious plane crash that unleashed a torrent 
				of sentient machines called Nanites and left the city a cordoned-off no man’s land. 
				Its five main areas (technically there are nine to explore, but you'll only really 
				spend a meaningful amount of time in five) all have a different look and feel - the 
				downtown shopping district, the port, the hospital/business district, etc - but 
				aside from one or two they all feel like variations on the same "urban wasteland" 
				template. By contrast, one of the things I really appreciated about the original 
				was that, while the different areas of the CREO complex all had some unifying 
				elements (corporate signage and propaganda, or the uniform design of the Science 
				Fiction Maintenance Tunnel), the thematic design of each zone was unique. The R and D 
				area, for instance, looked and felt completely different from the manufacturing 
				plant.</p>
				<h3>Verdict</h3>
				<p>The Surge 2 manages to recapture a lot of what made the original Souls-style 
				sci-fi adventure fun, even improving on its already-solid combat and gear grind 
				in several meaningful ways, from the added variety of weapons and enemies to the 
				simple but oh-so-welcome ability to build multiple equipment loadouts. It’s 
				missteps, however, made the sequel an overall lesser game than the original: 
				uninspired environmental design and overly ambitious story choices rob it of 
				the same level of satisfaction, even with the mechanical improvements. That 
				said, if you're just here to chop dudes in robot suits in half as you grind 
				up to the next power bracket or craft another piece of gear made out of severed 
				arms, you're probably gonna have a great time. Either way you'll likely still 
				have a good time, but will probably spend most of your playthrough fondly 
				remembering your first time.</p>
