				<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</h2>
				<p>Playing The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening is an exercise in time travel. 
				Ahead of the Switch remake, I replayed a 2011 version of a 1998 version of the 
				1993 original. I found the famously inscrutable handheld, top-down Zelda as 
				pleasingly difficult to scrute as ever. Its hazy, Twin Peaks-inspired story 
				and compact, twisting overworld were undimmed by time, but its dungeons were 
				slightly lacking by comparison with what came after, built frustratingly often 
				around just finding hidden areas rather than truly rewarding puzzle solving. 
				But just like a good time-travel yarn, the 2019 remake is out to correct mistakes 
				and make more perfect what came before. I’m happy to say that, having finished 
				this latest version of the story, all of my praise for Link’s Awakening remains 
				intact, and my reservations have practically disappeared.</p>
				<p>This is a remake in the true sense. The story, and every event in it, is completely 
				intact: it’s an offbeat tale told by turns charmingly and creepily, in which Link 
				is lost at sea and lands on the shores of Koholint Island before an owl sends him 
				to open a giant egg perched atop a mountain. If you haven’t played, this is an odd 
				one. Koholint itself retains every feature from the original – including elements 
				added for the 1998 Game Boy Color re-release – aside from the Camera Shop, which has 
				been made obsolete because we sadly don’t have Game Boy Printers anymore. Even in 
				that case, the Camera Shop area has been reopened as the new Chamber Dungeons 
				location (see boxout below) in its place. Additions are minimal. If you want some 
				guidance as to how minimal, “The crane game has a slightly different layout” was 
				one of the most substantial of my notes about changes.</p>

				<p>If you’re a seasoned fan, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you’re 
				very old. But the upside is that you’ll instantly know how to navigate yourself 
				from the beach Link washes up on, up through the rinky-dink houses of Mabe Village, 
				through the mists of the Mysterious Forest and, eventually, scale Tal Tal Heights 
				to reach the egg of the mysterious Wind Fish. It’s a remarkable work of imitation – the 
				world remains the same, down to individual squares of grass, and music ranges from 
				chiptune-infused covers to gorgeous orchestral reworks of Minako Hamano and Kozue 
				Ishikawa's original jaunty compositions. There’s a real pleasure in seeing what those 
				old pixel sprites ‘really’ looked like, too: those crystals you thought you smashed 
				were actually popped like balloons; that column-rolling globule of a mini-boss looks 
				horribly… wet? At points, this feels as much like digital tourism as it does a return 
				to an old adventure.</p>
				<h3>Verdict</h3>
				<p>My most succinct recommendation for the 2019 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s 
				Awakening would be this: a couple of weeks ago, having finished the original, I was 
				actively hoping that this wouldn’t be a shot-for-shot remake. Entire decades after 
				the fact, the dungeons felt a little underthought, the controls a bit archaic. Even 
				slowly making your way through the overworld by way of set clues, rather than the 
				kind of self-directed navigation we were allowed in A Link Between Worlds, felt 
				old-fashioned. And yet, as I potter once again across Koholint, digging up its last 
				remaining secrets to avoid turning it off again, I’m delighted to have been wrong. 
				Link’s Awakening retains the style and feel of its 1993 self, but looks and controls 
				like a game – albeit a retro-styled one – made in 2019. In doing so, this feels like 
				it was made in some alternate present, where games remained in 2D, puzzle-focused and 
				strange, but tech improved to support it all. You could, I guess, call it time travel.</p>
