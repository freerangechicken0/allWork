				<h2>Grid</h2>
				<p>The Grid games have been through a couple of moderate reinventions since 
				the TOCA spin-off franchise first debuted just over a decade ago. For this 
				fourth instalment – simply titled Grid – Codemasters has instead hit the reset
				button, opting for an overt return to this series’ 2008 roots rather than yet 
				another metamorphosis. Grid Junior is very much the resurrection of 2008’s Grid 
				Senior and, like its namesake, it straddles the line between arcade thrills and 
				something slightly more demanding, delivering exciting and dramatic racing action 
				alongside a modern makeover.</p>
				<p>Codemasters has earned a good deal of acclaim in recent years for its 
				aggressively hard-nosed racing sims like the F1 series and Dirt Rally, 
				but you should know that Grid is an altogether different beast. With some 
				tinkering in the options menu it can certainly be massaged into a mildly
				intimidating challenge that’ll spin around drivers who grab too much throttle
				while trying to hustle through an apex – and there’s always the spectre of 
				dealing with terminal damage without those optional rewinds if you so choose
				– but iRacing this is not. In its default state, Grid is a grippy, 
				hard-braking, and super-responsive racer that errs towards the arcade 
				end of the spectrum, and I can’t fault it for being faithful to the 
				spirit of its forebear. It’s fun to drive.</p>
				<img class="gif" src="grid.gif" alt="Grid Gif">
				<p>Accessible is probably an apt description for the handling model here, 
				but it’s not a one-size-fits-all deal and there are noticeable differences 
				between Grid’s wide range of vehicle types. For instance, GT beasts feel 
				stiff and planted compared to the somewhat soggier, oversteer-happy stock 
				cars. Grid reflects the unique characteristics of some of its iconic cars, 
				too, like the dreaded lag in a Ford Sierra Cosworth if you don’t keep the 
				turbo spooled up, or the insane downforce of the aero accessories on a 
				dedicated World Time Attack car, elbow-dropping them straight back onto 
				the track after they grab air. Some basic tuning sliders are present but 
				I mostly only messed with them to get some extra top-end speed on ovals.</p>
				<h3>Verdict</h3>
				<p>It’s more streamlined than the original in terms of team management and 
				it’s definitely way too lean on tracks, but Grid packs fun, fast-paced racing 
				into an easy-to-digest format. Sure, it’s unrealistic for the final race to 
				be Prototypes jumping up and down San Francisco’s iconic hills, but Grid isn’t 
				trying to be a realistic facsimile of modern racing. Hell, with throngs of 
				spectators dangling over the Armco, if Grid were realistic the tracks would 
				just be a sea of severed hands and heads. Instead, it’s a hyperbolic brand 
				of high-contact, Hollywood-style circuit and street racing delivered with 
				style and confidence.</p>
