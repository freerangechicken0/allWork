				<h2>Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</h2>
				<p>Ghost Recon Wildlands was a middling open-world shooter, but it wasn’t 
				entirely devoid of potential. With more diverse missions, a greater range 
				of tactical gadgets and abilities, and a better thought-out story, it might
				have succeeded in justifying its ludicrously huge world and absurd number
				of activities.</p>
				<p>As a sequel, Ghost Recon Breakpoint adds none of these things. In fact, 
				Breakpoint adds nothing of value to the Ghost Recon template. Instead, it 
				transplants into Wildlands’ structure several systems from other Ubisoft 
				franchises, systems that have no place in a game like Ghost Recon. Meanwhile,
				it actively removes some features that were present in Wildlands, while 
				making others considerably worse. In case I’ve not made it clear, I don’t 
				think it’s very good.</p>
				<img class="gif" src="ghostrecon.gif" alt="Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Gif">
				<p>At least the story isn’t likely to trigger a political incident, although 
				this is mainly because it’s unlikely to trigger any spark of emotion whatsoever. 
				Wildlands’ real-world setting of Bolivia has been switched out for the fictional
				island of Auroa, an offshore Silicon Valley where your friendly neighbourhood 
				techbro Jace Skell tries to make the world a better place by building killer 
				drones. At the game’s outset, Skell’s operation is hijacked by a former Ghost 
				named Walker (played by Jon Bernthal), who plans to use Skell’s drone army for 
				nonspecific Nefarious Means.</p>
				<p>Players assume the role of Nomad (which, incidentally, also means “Walker”,
				suggesting the writers struggled to come up with two generic soldier names) 
				deployed as part of a large team of Ghosts to investigate the situation on 
				Auroa. But the Ghost’s helicopters are shot down by the island’s automated 
				weapons system, and Nomad finds himself alone and hunted through the forest 
				by Walker’s gang of mercenaries who call themselves the “Wolves.”</p>
				<h3>Verdict</h3>
				<p>Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a bizarre Frankenstein’s monster of a shooter, 
				functional in a basic sense, but fundamentally at odds with every second of 
				its own existence. The only breakpoint represented here is for Ubisoft’s 
				carte-blanche open world design, which completely loses sight of the core 
				experience Ghost Recon is supposed to offer. The systems borrowed from other 
				Ubisoft games are about as fitting for a tactical shooter as a clown suit 
				and a megaphone, while the toolbox available to the player is nowhere near 
				deep enough to spread across the hundreds of samey activities filling the 
				world. If Wildlands was disappointing, Breakpoint edges close to disaster.</p>
