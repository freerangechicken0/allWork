				<h2>Code Vein</h2>
				<p>If you’ve seen a trailer or any preview footage for Code Vein, the elevator
				pitch is clear: It’s an “anime Soulslike” – an action-RPG that promises the steep
				challenge and cautious combat that we’ve all become very acquainted with in recent
				years. Code Vein doesn’t simply layer generic anime style and storytelling on top 
				of a Souls clone and call it a day, though: its unique post-apocalyptic 
				sci-fi-meets-anime horror atmosphere stands out, and its flexible class system 
				and an AI partner distinguish it from its peers mechanically. Some of those ideas 
				make things more frustrating than they need to be at times, but in this kind of 
				game, a healthy dose of frustration comes with the territory. Code Vein deserves 
				some credit for experimenting with this firmly established formula in ways others 
				often don't.</p>
				<p>True to its anime inspirations, Code Vein has a lot of story. Your custom 
				character awakens in the ruins of a city as an undead “revenant” who feeds 
				on blood in a wild, Mad Max-style, ghoul-eat-ghoul world. There are more 
				revenants than people, which means food is scarce. The story itself is deadly 
				serious, but there’s a bit of a wacky streak – including white trees that 
				literally grow “beads” of blood. That makes the world interesting, but the 
				wild designs sometimes felt out of place with the story’s bleak tone.</p>
				<img class="gif" src="codevein.gif" alt="Code Vein Gif">
				<p>You quickly link up with a likable but two-dimensional crew of allies who 
				realize you have special abilities, sending you on a long and winding quest 
				that’s equal parts saving the world and figuring out what the hell is going 
				on. The story kept me involved (even when it goes off the rails) by unfurling 
				details about the world as you go. It seems like everyone has amnesia, so 
				every story thread has a mystery of some kind. While the revelations are 
				never as powerful (or as clarifying) as those in, say, Horizon: Zero Dawn, 
				the slow drip of information filled in my understanding of what has happened 
				and how it connects to the people, places, and things I’d seen.</p>
				<p>While the main plot relies on cutscenes, many of the individual characters' 
				stories play out through blood echoes, slow-moving story sequences where you 
				walk (very slowly) through corridors with still images that sync up to audio 
				logs. I don’t have a problem with this kind of secondary storytelling, but I 
				wish that more of these more interesting stories could have been better integrated 
				into the main plot, rather than bringing the pace to a crawl to develop its 
				characters and deliver important details about the world.</p>
				<h3>Verdict</h3>
				<p>Despite building itself on well-tread ground, Code Vein definitely moves to 
				the beat of its own drummer, but that beat can lose its rhythm when you need 
				it to be steady. Some changes like being able to easily switch around and 
				experiment with classes on the fly are great, while others like its inconsistent 
				AI partner could be more trouble than they were worth at times. But in both the 
				good and the bad, I appreciated its enthusiasm for mixing things up and getting 
				a little weird. If you’re looking for a unique take on a familiar type of 
				challenge, and are open to loving and hating a game for its many mechanical 
				quirks in the same breath, Code Vein is worth sinking your teeth into.</p>
